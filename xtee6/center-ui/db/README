I did not manage to get both migrations work and central up and running
when migrations were in center-common project where these are supposed to be.

TODO: Later move migrations to center-common, so that center-ui comes up as
well.

To migrate successfully in devel, copy folder center-common/db/migrate right
here!

rake db:migrate and rake db:rollback should be run from this project
(center-ui).
In production environment run:

rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
