This directory contains a SoapUI project file (test_service_mock_project.xml) 
of the mock services used for simulating a service provider's information system
in the testing environment that can be deployed as WAR file.

Packaging the SoapUI project was tested with SoapUI OpenSource version 5.0.0 
(available from https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui.html).

To deploy the mock services as WAR file, the following steps are necessary.

Import the SOAPUI project file (File > Import Project).

Right-click on the project and select the 'Deploy as War' option 
at the bottom of the menu.

Check the enable WebUI checkbox if you want to view the mock service request
log using the WebUI.

Insert 'http://xtee2:8088/operational_monitoring_mock_service' as MockService Endpoint.

Fill in the 'War File' and 'War Directory' with the file name and directory of your choice.

Click 'OK'.
