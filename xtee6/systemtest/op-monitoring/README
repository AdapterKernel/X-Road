This directory contains the various test suites and helper code
for testing the Operational Monitoring system at various levels.

The dependencies for each testing level are described in the corresponding
subdirectory (integration and load).

Unit tests are integrated into the build system of the respective
source code modules and are not covered here.

Please read the docs in doc/OperationalMonitoring/Testing/ for an
overview of the testing strategy and the expected environment.

The contents of this directory:

- integration: Source code, request templates etc for running the integration
  test suite of the Operational Monitoring system.

- load: Source code for running the load test simulations of the Operational
  Monitoring system.

- misc: One-off scripts and various files used for manual testing.

- mock: Configuration of the SoapUI-based mock service used for simulating
  a service provider's information system in the testing environment.

- python_common: A library of reusable code for the integration and load tests.

- requests: Sample SOAP requests that can be used for manual testing.

- zabbix_api: Sample scripts, configuration and JSON-RPC requests for configuring
  Zabbix over its API. The zabbix_api/examples/zabbix/ directory is included
  in the .deb and .rpm packages of the Operational Monitoring Daemon. These scripts
  do not (and should not) use the code in python_common, but should be self-contained.
