The integration test suite has the following dependencies:

Python 3.4 under Ubuntu 14.04

Additional dependencies:
sudo apt-get install python3-requests
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install typing

Expecting key-based SSH access to the security servers and passwordless sudo
inside the security servers.
Use ~/.ssh/config for custom usernames and key paths.
Alternatively, an SSH user can be supplied with the --ssh-user command line
argument if the same user is suitable for running remote commands on all
the servers.

The general idea is to make various regular X-Road (SOAP) requests and check operational
data and health data using the respective SOAP requests. Direct database access
is not used for checking the results of requests.

The tests assume the corresponding environment has been set up based on the
documentation in doc/OperationalMonitoring/Testing/ .

Sample usage:

# Set PYTHONUNBUFFERED so the output is not mangled.
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=true ./run_tests.py --client-security-server <name_or_address> --producer-security-server <name_or_address> --ssh-user <user>

A single test case can be run similarly to the following example:

PYTHONUNBUFFERED=true ./run_tests.py --client-security-server <name_or_address> --producer-security-server <name_or_address> \
  --ssh-user <user> OperationalMonitoringIntegrationTest.test_simple_store_and_query
