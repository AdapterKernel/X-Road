# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Target Audience

The intended audience of this User Guide are X-Road central server administrators who are responsible for everyday management of the X-Road central server.

Instructions for the installation and initial configuration of the central server can be found in the Central Server Installation Guide [CSI]. Instructions for installing the central server in a cluster for achieving high availability can be found in the Central Server High Availability Installation Guide [IG-CSHA].

# 2. User Management

## 2.1 User Roles

The central server supports the following user roles:

- Registration Officer (xroad-registration-officer) is responsible for handling the information about X-Road members.
- System Administrator (xroad-system-administrator) is responsible for the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the central server.
- Security Officer (xroad-security-officer) is responsible for the application of the security policy and security requirements.

One user can have multiple roles, and multiple users can fulfill the same role. Each role has a corresponding system group, created upon the installation of the system. The system user names are used for logging in to the user interface of the central server.

The document indicates in sections similar to the following example, which user role is required for performing a particular action in the user interface. For example

`Access rights: System Administrator`

Caution: If the logged-in user does not have a permission to carry out a task, the button that initiates the action is hidden (and neither is it possible to run the task using its corresponding keyboard combinations or mouse actions). Only the permitted information and actions are visible and available to the user.

## 2.2 Managing the Users

During the installation, a super user equipped with all the roles is created. You can create additional users that have restricted rights. User management is carried out in root user's permissions using the command line.

To add a new user, issue the command:

`adduser username`

To grant permissions to the user you created, add it to the corresponding system groups, for example:

`adduser username xroad-registration-officer`<br>
`adduser username xroad-system-administrator`<br>
`adduser username xroad-security-officer`

To remove a user’s permission, remove the user from the corresponding system group, for example:

`deluser username xroad-registration-officer`

To remove a user, enter:

`deluser username`

# 3. Standalone and High-Availability Systems

The central server can be installed and configured in two ways:
- A standalone server
- A cluster of independent central servers (nodes) providing high availability (HA). In an HA setup, the system continues to function if one or more of the nodes are experiencing problems or are down for maintenance.

In the case of an HA setup, the changes to the databases of each central server are replicated to the other nodes. While most of the system settings described in this document apply to the whole cluster, some have a meaning that is local to each node, although the database records are replicated. In addition, all the configuration signing keys are local to each node and must be generated separately. This distinction will be stated explicitly throughout this document, where necessary.

In an HA setup, if the system is configured using different nodes in parallel, the effect will be similar to several people updating the configuration of a standalone server at the same time.

## 3.1 Detecting the Type of Deployment in the User Interface

In order to detect the type of deployment and the name of the node in the cluster in the case of HA setup, the logged-in user should check the instance identifier displayed in the left upper corner of the user interface. In the case of an HA setup, the name of the node is displayed to the right of the instance identifier in parentheses.

## 3.2 Checking the Status of the Nodes of the Cluster

In order to check the status of the nodes in an HA setup, the following script can be used on the command line:

`/usr/share/xroad/scripts/check_ha_cluster_status.py`

# 4. System Settings
## 4.1 Managing the Member Classes

Access rights: Security Officer

To add a member class, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select System Settings.
2. Locate the Member Classes section and click Add.
3. In the window that opens, enter the member class code and description. Click OK.

To edit the description of a member class, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select System Settings.
2. Locate the Member Classes section, select a member class and click Edit.
3. In the window that opens, enter the member class description and click OK.

To delete a member class, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select System Settings.
2. Locate the Member Classes section, select a member class and click Delete.

Only the member classes that are used by none of the X-Road members can be deleted.

## 4.2 Configuring the Management Service Provider

The central server provides management services to the security servers that are part of the (local) X-Road infrastructure (see Chapter 6).

A subsystem of an X-Road member acting as a service provider for the management services must be appointed in the central server (see 4.2.1), registered as a client of the management services’ security server (see 4.2.2) and configured to provide the services in the management services’ security server (see 4.2.3).

The management services’ security server must be installed and registered in the central server before the management service provider can be registered as a client of the security server and the management services can be configured (see [SSI]).

### 4.2.1 Appointing the Management Service Provider

Access rights: Security Officer

To appoint the management service provider in the central server, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select System Settings.
2. Locate the Management Services section and click Edit.
3. In the window that opens, find the subsystem of an X-Road member to be appointed as the management service provider and click OK.

### 4.2.2 Registering the Management Service Provider as a Security Server Client

The management service provider can be registered as a security server client as described in this section only if the management service provider is not registered as a client of any security servers. In case the management service provider is already a client of a security server then the identifier of the security server is displayed instead of the Register button.

To register the appointed management service provider as a security server client to the management services’ security server, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select System Settings.
2. Locate the Management Services section and click Register.
3. Locate the "Security Server Information" section on the registration request form, click Search and select the security server that will be used as the management services’ security server.
4. Click Submit to submit the registration request.

On successful registration the identifier of the management services’ security server is displayed instead of the Register button.

### 4.2.3 Configuring the Management Services in the Management Services’ Security Server

Access rights: Security server’s Service Administrator

The data necessary for configuring the management services in the security server can be found at the central server Management -> System Settings -> Management Services section.

To configure management services in the management services’ security server, follow these steps.

1. On the Configuration menu of the security server, select Security Server Clients, select the client who will provide the management services and click the Services icon on that row.
2. Click Add WSDL, enter the management services WSDL address in the window that opens and click OK.
3. Expand the WSDL, by clicking the + icon, select a service and click Edit.
4. In the window that opens, enter the management services address. If necessary, edit other service parameters. Check the Apply to All in WSDL checkbox and click OK. Ensure that the parameters of all the management services have changed.
5. Activate the management service’s WSDL by selecting the row of the WSDL and clicking Enable.
6. Navigate to the Service Clients tab.
7. Click Add and search for the global group security-server-owners. Select the group and click Next.
8. In the window that opens, click Add All to ACL to add all management services (authCertDeletion, clientDeletion, clientReg) to the security-server-owners group’s access rights list.

## 4.3 Configuring the Central Server Address

Access rights: Security Officer

In the System Settings view, the central server's public DNS name or its external IP address is displayed. This address is used by the security servers to access the services provided by the central server (configuration download, management services).

**ATTENTION!** When the central server address is changed,

- the management services address in the management services’ security server needs to be reconfigured,
- the internal configuration anchor need to be redistributed to the security server administrators and
- the external configuration anchor needs to be redistributed to the federation partners.

The services provided by the central server must be available from both the new and old address, until all servers using the services have uploaded the configuration anchor containing the new address.

### 4.3.1 Notes on HA Setup

In an HA setup, the address of the central server is local to the node that is being configured.

In an HA setup, internal and external configuration anchors contain information about each central server that is part of the cluster. If the address of one of the servers is changed, configuration anchors will be re-generated automatically on all the nodes.

### 4.3.2 Changing the Central Server Address

To change the central server address, follow these steps.

1. In the Management menu, select System Settings.
2. Locate the System Parameters section and click Edit.
3. Enter the central server’s address and click OK. When the address is changed, the system:
  - changes the management services WSDL address,
  - changes the management services address,
  - changes the configuration source addresses,
  - generates new configuration anchors for the internal and external configuration sources.
4. After the central server address is changed, act as follows.
  - Download the internal configuration source anchor and distribute the anchor along with the anchor’s hash value to the security server administrators of the local X-Road infrastructure.
  - In case of federated X-Road systems, download the external configuration source anchor and distribute the anchor along with the anchor’s hash value to the federation partners.
  - Reconfigure the management services addresses in the management service security server.

# 5. Configuration Management

## 5.1 Viewing the Configuration Settings

Access rights: Security Officer, System Administrator

- The configuration management view consists of three sections.
The Internal Configuration View. The internal configuration is distributed by the central server to the security servers of the local X-Road infrastructure. The information needed to download and verify the internal configuration is included in the internal configuration anchor, which must be distributed to the security server administrators and uploaded to the security servers. Along with the internal configuration anchor, the anchor file hash value must be distributed. The hash value is used by the security server administrators to verify the integrity of the anchor file.
- The External Configuration View. The external configuration is distributed by the central server to the federation partners (either to the security servers directly or through a configuration proxy). The information needed to download and verify the external configuration is included in the external configuration anchor, which must be distributed to the federation partner’s central server (or configuration proxy) administrators and uploaded to the central server (or configuration proxy). Along with the external configuration anchor, the anchor file hash value must be distributed. The hash value is used by the federation partners to verify the integrity of the anchor file.
- The Trusted Anchors View. A trusted anchor is the configuration anchor of the configuration source(s) distributing the external configuration of a federation partner. Upon loading the trusted anchor into the central server, the anchor is included into the internal configuration, allowing the security servers to download the external configuration of a federation partner as well as the internal configuration of the local X-Road infrastructure.

## 5.2 Downloading the Configuration Anchor

Access rights: Security Officer

To download a configuration anchor, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration view, as appropriate.
2. In the Anchor section, click Download and save the prompted file.

## 5.3 Re-Creating the Configuration Anchor

Access rights: Security Officer

Normally, the configuration anchors are generated (and in an HA setup, distributed to every node) automatically by the system upon changes in the data included in the anchor (one or more central server addresses, signing keys). The re-creation of an anchor is necessary only for recovering from error situations.

To re-create an anchor, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration view, as appropriate.
2. In the Anchor section, click Re-Create.

## 5.4 Changing the Configuration Signing Keys

Access rights: Security Officer

Key change can be either
- regular change – the key is changed periodically (for example, annually) to minimize the risk of exposure;
- emergency change – the key and all its back-ups have been destroyed or the key has been exposed.

As the key change must be carried out efficiently without disrupting the operation of X-Road, the procedure is completed in two stages, wherein the old key and the new key can exist in parallel.

Note that in an HA setup, each node has its own set of configuration signing keys. The old and new key can exist in parallel on each node. Regular key change should cover all the nodes in a cluster and the new configuration anchor should be distributed after the keys have been changed on each node.

The steps of key change are as follows:

- First, a new key is generated (on each node in HA setups) and the configuration anchor containing the public key part(s) of the key(s) is distributed to X-Road participants. Until all participants have received the public key(s), the old (i.e. current) key(s) is/are used for signing configuration.
- Then, after all participants have received and uploaded the new public key(s), the old key(s) is/are removed and the new key(s) is/are used to sign configuration.

To perform a regular key change, follow these steps.

1. Generate, but do not activate a new configuration signing key (see 5.4.1) (in an HA setup, for each node). The system uses the old (active) key(s) to sign the configuration. Upon the generation of a new key, the system generates a new anchor for the corresponding configuration sources.
2. Download the anchor (see 5.2) containing the public key part(s) of the new signing key(s) and distribute the anchor along with the anchor file hash value either to the security server administrators (in case of internal configuration anchor) or to the federation partners (in case of external configuration anchor).
3. Activate the new signing key(s) (see 5.4.2).
The new signing key(s) should only be activated after all the affected server administrators have received and uploaded the distributed anchor. The central servers use the active key to sign configuration. If a server administrator has not uploaded the configuration anchor containing the public key part of the new key before the new key is activated, the verification of the downloaded configuration in the security servers will fail and the services exchange with the X-Road participants described in the configuration will be discontinued.
4. Delete the old signing key (in an HA setup, delete the old keys on all the nodes) (see 5.4.3). Upon the deletion of a key, the system generates a new configuration anchor.
5. Download the generated anchor (it does not contain the public key part(s) of the old signing key(s)) and distribute the anchor along with the anchor file hash value either to the security server administrators (in case of internal configuration anchor) or to the federation partners (in case of external configuration anchor).

To perform an emergency key change, the new key must be activated and the old key deleted immediately after the generation of the new key (in the steps described above, step 2 is skipped). The configuration anchor distributed to the security server administrators (in case of internal configuration anchor) or to the federation partners (in case of external configuration anchor) must only contain the public key part of the new signing key.

### 5.4.1 Generating a Configuration Signing Key

Access rights: Security Officer

To generate a configuration signing key, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration view, as appropriate.
2. In the Signing Keys section, click New Key.
3. In a window that opens, select a key device, insert a label for the key, and click OK.
4. If needed, enter the key device’s PIN (PIN is asked, when the device has not been logged in to).

The system will automatically generate the corresponding configuration anchor containing the public key part of the generated key.
If the generated key is the only signing key for the configuration source, the key will automatically be set as active (the active key is displayed in bold font style).

### 5.4.2 Activating a Configuration Signing Key

Access rights: Security Officer

To activate a configuration signing key, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration view, as appropriate.
2. In the Signing Keys section, select an inactive key (the active key is displayed in bold font style) and click Activate.

### 5.4.3 Deleting a Configuration Signing Key

Access rights: Security Officer

To delete a configuration signing key, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration view, as appropriate.
2. In the Signing Keys section, select an inactive key (the active key is displayed in bold font style) and click Delete.
3. Confirm the deletion by clicking Confirm.

## 5.5 Viewing the Contents of a Configuration Part

Access rights: Security Officer, System Administrator

The contents of a configuration part can be viewed by downloading the configuration part file.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select either the Internal Configuration or External Configuration view, as appropriate.
2. In the Configuration Parts section, select a configuration part and click Download.
3. Save or open the prompted file.

## 5.6 Uploading a Trusted Anchor

Access rights: Security Officer

To upload a trusted anchor, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select the Trusted Anchors view.
2. Click Upload Anchor, find the external configuration anchor received from a federation partner and click Upload.
3. Verify the integrity of the anchor file by comparing the displayed anchor file hash value with the hash value provided by the federation partner and confirm the anchor upload by clicking Confirm.

In case a previous anchor from the same federation partner has been uploaded to the system, the new anchor will replace the old one.

## 5.7 Viewing the Contents of a Trusted Anchor

Access rights: Security Officer, System Administrator

The contents of a trusted anchor can be viewed by downloading the anchor file.
To download an anchor file, follow these steps.

1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select the Trusted Anchors view.
2. In the anchor section, click Download.
3. Save or open the prompted file.

## 5.8 Deleting a Trusted Anchor

Access rights: Security Officer

To delete an anchor file, follow these steps.
1. On the Management menu, select Configuration Management and select the Trusted Anchors view.
2. In the anchor section, click Delete.
3. Confirm the deletion by clicking Confirm.

# 6. The Management Requests System
## 6.1 Registration Requests

As the registration of associations in the X-Road governing authority is security-critical, the following measures are applied to increase security:

- The registration request must be submitted to the X-Road governing authority over two channels, or in other words, the registration wish must be expressed through two complementary requests:
one request is submitted to the X-Road central server through the security server,
the other request is submitted to the X-Road governing authority through means independent of the X-Road (for example, over a digitally signed e-mail). This request must be formalized in the central server by the central server administrator.
- The association must be approved by the X-Road governing authority.

There are two types of registration requests:

- authentication certificate registration request (see Sections 7.4 and 8.3);
- security server client registration request (see Section 7.5).

### 6.1.1 State Machine Model for Registration Requests

A registration request can be in one of the following states. See Figure 1 for the state machine diagram.

![alt text](state-machine-diagram-for-registration-requests.png "State machine diagram for registration requests")

Figure 1. State machine diagram for registration requests

Waiting – a registration request has been submitted either from a security server or formalized in the central server, but the complementary request has not been submitted. From this state, the request can move to the following states.
- “Submitted for approval”, if the complementary request is received (see 7.4, 7.5 and 8.3).
- “Revoked”.
  - Registration request received from a security server are automatically revoked by deletion requests sent from the security server for the same object that was submitted for registration with the registration request.
  - Registration request formalized in the central server can be revoked by the central server administrator in the central server (see 7.4, 7.5 and 8.3). A deletion request for the same object that was submitted for registration with the registration request is created upon revocation.

Submitted for approval – both complementary requests have been submitted to the central server, but the association between the objects of the registration request has not been approved. From this state, the request can move to the following states.
- “Approved”, if the registration request is approved in the central server (see 7.4, 7.5 and 8.3).
- “Declined”, if the registration request is declined in the central server (see 7.4, 7.5 and 8.3).

Approved – the complementary registration requests have been approved. The association between the objects of the registration request has been created.

Declined – the complementary registration requests have been declined.

Revoked – a registration request has been revoked.

## 6.2 Deletion Requests

Complementary requests are not needed for association deletion requests. Associations are deleted on the basis of a single request, which is either submitted through a security server or formalized in the central server.

Deletion requests are
- authentication certificate deletion request (see Section 8.4);
- security server client deletion request (see Section 7.6).

## 6.3 Viewing the Management Request Details

Access rights: Registration Officer

To open the detail view, follow these steps.
1. On the main menu, select Management and then Management Requests.
2. Select from the table a request and either double-click it or click Details.

There are three data sections in the view.

1. Information about the request.
  - Request ID – the identifier of the request;
  - Received – the date and time of saving the request in the central server;
  - Source – the source of the request. The request can be either submitted through a security server (SECURITY_SERVER) or created in the central server (CENTER);
  - Status (only for registration requests) – the state of the request, see Figure 1;
  - Complementary/Revoking request ID (only for registration requests) – the identifier of the request that caused the status change of this request from "Waiting" to "Submitted for approval" or from "Waiting" to "Revoked";
  - Comments – the source event for the automatic generation of the request. For example, when a security server is deleted from the central server, deletion requests are automatically generated for all the clients and authentication certificates registered for this security server. In the "Comments" field of the generated requests, a comment with the server identifier is added in such case. This field is left empty for requests that are not automatically generated by the central server.
2. Information about the security server associated with the request.
  - Owner Name – the name of the security server owner (X-Road member);
  - Owner Class – the member class of the security server owner;
  - Owner Code – the member code of the security server owner;
  - Server Code – the code of the security server;
  - Address – the address of the security server. The field is filled only for authentication certificate registration requests submitted through a security server, and only if the security server's administration deemed it necessary to provide an address upon request submission.
3. Information about the request object – that is, the client or the authentication certificate being registered or deleted.

## 13.3 Restoring the Configuration from the Command Line

To restore configuration from the command line, the following data must be available:
- the instance ID of the central server and,
- in HA setup, the node name of the central server.

It is expected that the restore command is run by the xroad user.

Use the following command to restore configuration in non-HA setup:
`/usr/share/xroad/scripts/restore_xroad_center_configuration.sh -i <instance_ID> -f <path + filename>`

In HA setup, this command has an additional mandatory parameter, the node name:
`/usr/share/xroad/scripts/restore_xroad_center_configuration.sh -i <instance_ID> -n <node_name> -f <path + filename>`

For example (all in one line, non-HA setup):
`/usr/share/xroad/scripts/restore_xroad_center_configuration.sh -i EE -f /var/lib/xroad/backup/conf_backup_20140707_200916.tar`

For example (all in one line, HA setup):
`/usr/share/xroad/scripts/restore_xroad_center_configuration.sh -i EE -n node_0 -f /var/lib/xroad/backup/conf_backup_20140707_200916.tar`

If it is absolutely necessary to restore the system from a backup made on a different central server, the forced mode of the restore command can be used with the –F option. For example:
`/usr/share/xroad/scripts/restore_xroad_center_configuration.sh -F -f /var/lib/xroad/backup/conf_backup_20140707_200916.tar`

## 13.4 Downloading, Uploading and Deleting Configuration Backup Files

- click Upload Backup File, select a file to be uploaded and click OK. The uploaded configuration file appears in the list of configuration files.

# 14. Audit Log

The central server keeps an audit log of the events performed by the central server administrator. The audit log events are generated by the user interface when the user changes the system’s state or configuration. The user actions are logged regardless of whether the outcome of the action was a success or a failure. The complete list of the audit log events is described in [SPEC-AL].

Actions that change the system’s state or configuration but are not carried out using the user interface are not logged (for example, X-Road software installation and upgrade, user creation and permission granting, and changing of the configuration files in the file system).

An audit log record contains
- the description of the user action,
- the date and time of the event,
- the username of the user that performed the action, and
- the data related to the event.

For example, adding a new member in the central server produces the following log record:

`2015-07-03T11:40:52+03:00 my-central-server-host INFO  [X-Road Center UI] 2015-07-03 11:40:52+0300 - {"event":"Add member","user":"admin1", "data":{"memberName":"member1 name","memberClass":"COM", "memberCode":"member1"}}`

The event is present in JSON [JSON] format, in order to ensure machine processability. The field event represents the description of the event, the field user represents the user name of the performer, and the field data represents data related with the event. The failed action event record contains an additional field reason for the error message. For example:

`2015-07-03T11:51:24+03:00 my-central-server-host INFO  [X-Road Center UI] 2015-07-03 11:51:24+0300 - {"event":"Log in to token failed","user":"admin1", "reason":"PIN incorrect","data":{"tokenId":"0","tokenSerialNumber":null, "tokenFriendlyName":"softToken-0"}}`

By default, audit log is located in the file

`/var/log/xroad/audit.log`

## 14.1 Changing the Configuration of the Audit Log

The X-Road software writes the audit log to the syslog (rsyslog) using UDP interface (default port is 514). Corresponding configuration is located in the file

`/etc/rsyslog.d/90-udp.conf`

The audit log records are written with level INFO and facility LOCAL0. By default, log records of that level and facility are saved to the X-Road audit log file

`/var/log/xroad/audit.log`

The default behavior can be changed by editing the rsyslog configuration file

`/etc/rsyslog.d/40-xroad.conf`

Restart the rsyslog service to apply the changes made to the configuration file

`restart rsyslog`

The audit log is rotated monthly by logrotate. To configure the audit log rotation, edit the logrotate configuration file

`/etc/logrotate.d/xroad-center`

## 14.2 Archiving the Audit Log

In order to save hard disk space and avoid loss of the audit log records during central server crash, it is recommended to archive the audit log files periodically to an external storage or a log server.

The X-Road software does not offer special tools for archiving the audit log. The rsyslog can be configured to redirect the audit log to an external location.

# 15. Monitoring

Monitoring is taken to use by installing the monitoring support (see [IG-CS]) and appointing the central monitoring client as specified below.

Identity of central monitoring client (if any) is configured using central server's admin user interface. Configuration is done by updating a specific optional configuration file (see [UC-GCONF]) monitoring-params.xml. This configuration file is distributed to all security servers through the global configuration distribution process (see [UC-GCONF]).

```xml
<tns:conf xmlns:id="http://x-road.eu/xsd/identifiers" xmlns:tns="http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd">
    <monitoringClient>
        <monitoringClientId id:objectType="SUBSYSTEM">
            <id:xRoadInstance>fdev</id:xRoadInstance>
            <id:memberClass>GOV</id:memberClass>
            <id:memberCode>1710128-9</id:memberCode>
            <id:subsystemCode>LIPPIS</id:subsystemCode>
        </monitoringClientId>
    </monitoringClient>
</tns:conf>
```

One can configure either one member or a member's subsystem to be the central monitoring client. Permission to execute monitoring queries is strictly limited to that single member or subsystem - defining one subsystem to be a monitoring client does not grant the corresponding member access to querying monitoring data (and vice versa).

To disable central monitoring client altogether, update configuration to one which has no client:

```xml
<tns:conf xmlns:id="http://x-road.eu/xsd/identifiers" xmlns:tns="http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd">
    <monitoringClient>
    </monitoringClient>
</tns:conf>
```

# 16. Additional configuration options
## 16.1 Verify next update

For additional robustness the OCSP [RFC-OCSP] response verifier can be configured to skip checking of nextUpdate parameter. By default the checking is turned on and to turn it off the user has to take action.

Configuration is done by updating a specific optional configuration file (see [UC-GCONF]) nextupdate-params.xml. This configuration file is distributed to all security servers through the global configuration distribution process (see [UC-GCONF]).

```xml
<xro:conf xmlns:xro="http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd">
  <verifyNextUpdate>true</verifyNextUpdate>
</xro:conf>
```

With verifyNextUpdate element value “false” the nextUpdate parameter checking is switched off.

## 16.2 OCSP fetch interval

The xroad-signer component has a specific interval how often it downloads new OCSP [RFC-OCSP] responses. By default the fetch interval is configured to 3600 seconds. To use something else than the default value a global configuration extension part (see [UC-GCONF]) of specific format can be uploaded to central server.

```xml
<xro:conf xmlns:xro="http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd">
    <ocspFetchInterval>3600</ocspFetchInterval>
</xro:conf>
```

The value is the fetch interval in seconds for new OCSP responses.

# 17. Logs and System Services

Most significant central server services are the following:

| Service        | Purpose           | Log  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| xroad-jetty     | The application server providing the user interface and the request acceptance service. | `/var/log/xroad/jetty/` |
| xroad-signer      | The service that manages key settings.      |   `/var/log/xroad/signer.log` |
| nginx | The Web server that distributes configuration and implements the TLS protocol in the user interface.      |    `/var/log/nginx/` |

System services can be managed using the upstart facility.
To start a service, issue the following command as a root user:

`service <service> start`

To stop a service, enter:

`service <service> stop`

To read logs, a user must have root user's rights or belong to the xroad system group.

For logging, the Logback system is used.

Logback configuration files are stored in the `/etc/xroad/conf.d/` directory.

Default settings for logging are the following:
- logging level: INFO;
- rolling policy: whenever file size reaches 100 MB.
