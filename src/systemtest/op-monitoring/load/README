The load test suite of the Operational Monitoring system uses Gatling
as the simulation tool.

Please refer to these instructions for obtaining Gatling:
http://gatling.io/docs/2.2.3/quickstart.html

The gatling.sh script must be added to the PATH variable of the user
running the simulations.

We assume the corresponding environment has been set up based on the
documentation in doc/OperationalMonitoring/Testing/ .

The simulation setup can be described in two ways:
* Copy SimulationSetup.scala_sample to SimulationSetup.scala and edit it to your needs
* Specify the Gatling code of the simulation via the SIMULATION_SETUP environment
  variable. If this variable is set, it takes precedence over the existing file.
  Using the environment variable is convenient under continuous integration systems.

The report of the simulation is written to a subdirectory with the name pattern
load_test_results_<simulation_start_timestamp>.
