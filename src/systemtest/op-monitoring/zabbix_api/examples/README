This directory contains example Zabbix related scripts and configuration files
that are useful for testing and that are included in the xroad-opmonitor
package, installed under /usr/share/doc/xroad-opmonitor/examples .

Because the RPM packages may be installed to systems under which Python3 and
python3-requests are not conveniently available, the sample scripts use
Python 2.7.
