## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the events that take place in the operational monitoring daemon during the communication with security server and/or with an external monitoring system (e.g. Zabbix).

The use cases include verifications that take place, and the main error conditions that may be encountered during the described process. The general system errors that may be encountered in most of the use cases (e.g., database connection errors or out of memory errors) are not described in this document.

## 2 Overview

The main function of the operational monitoring daemon is to collect operational monitoring data and health data of the X-Road security server(s). The operational monitoring daemon makes operational and health data available for the owner of the security server, regular client and central monitoring client via security server. Local health data is available for external monitoring systems (e.g. Zabbix) over JMXMP interface.

An overview of the components of the monitoring daemon and its interfaces is provided in [[ARC-OPMOND]](#ARC-OPMOND).

## 3 Use Case Model

### 3.1 Actors

The X-Road monitoring use case model includes the following actors.

- Security server -- A local security server that sends operational data stored in the operational monitoring buffer to the monitoring daemon and mediates operational data messages between operational monitoring daemon and remote security servers.

- External monitoring system -- A monitoring tool (e.g. Zabbix) that collects local security server health data via JMXMP interface.

The relationships between the actors and use cases are described in Figure 1.

### 3.2 UC OPMON_01: Store the Operational Data in the Operational Monitoring Database

**Level:** System task

**Actors:** Security server

**Brief Description:** Security server stores operational data in the operational monitoring buffer and sends the stored information to the monitoring daemon. The operational monitoring database component collects operational data of the X-Road security server(s) via store operational data interface.

**Preconditions:** -

**Postconditions:** -

**Trigger:** A security server sends operational data stored in the operational monitoring buffer to the monitoring daemon.

**Main Success Scenario:**

1. System receives the data storing request containing the following operational monitoring data fields (the fields not marked as mandatory are optional):
    * the internal IP of the security server (mandatory);
    * type of the security server (either *Client* or *Producer*; mandatory);
    * request in timestamp (In the client's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the request was received by the client's security server. In the service provider's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the request was received by the service provider's security server. Mandatory.);
    * request out timestamp (In the client's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the request was sent out from the client's security server to the client's information system. In the service provider's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the request was sent out from the service provider's security server. If the request is either a metadata request or a proxy monitoring data request the value of the parameter is equal to ‘request in timestamp’);
    * response in timestamp (In the client's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the response was received by the client's security server. In the service provider's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the response was received by the service provider's security server. If the request is either a metadata request or a proxy monitoring data request the value of the parameter is equal to ‘response out timestamp’);
    * response out timestamp (In the client's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the response was sent out from the client's security server to the client's information system. In the service provider's security server: the Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the response was sent out from the service provider's security server. Mandatory.);
    * the X-Road instance identifier of the instance used by the client;
    * the member class of the X-Road member (client);

### 3.3 UC OPMON_02: Query Operational Data

**Level:** System task

**Actors:** Security server

**Brief Description:** Security server receives an operational data request and sends the request to the operational monitoring daemon. The sender of the original request can be either the owner of the security server, a regular client or a central monitoring client. System parses the operational data request and composes a response. If the request included the list of the requested operational data parameters only requested parameters are included in the response. Otherwise, the response contains all parameters listed in UC MON_01 step 1. The internal IP of the security server is included in the response only for the owner of the security server and the central monitoring client.

**Preconditions:** -

**Postconditions:** System has replied with a response message.

**Trigger:** The operational monitoring daemon receives an operational data request from the security server.

**Main Success Scenario:**

1. System receives an operational data request. The request includes the following information:
    * the beginning of the time interval of requested operational data (the Unix timestamp in seconds);
    * the end of the time interval of requested operational data (the Unix timestamp in seconds);
    * the identifier of a client the operational data is requested about (optional);
    * the set of the requested operational data parameters (optional; parameters are described in UC MON_01 step 1; if not filled the response contains all listed parameters).
2. System parses the request and verifies that the beginning of time interval of requested operational data is smaller than the end of the time interval.
3. System verifies the request is coming from central monitoring client (defined in the global configuration). System queries requested operational data records of either one client that is specified in the search criteria of the request or all clients (if the client is not specified in the search criteria) according to the time interval given in the request.
4. System composes the response including all operational data records from the given time interval.
5. System replies with a response message.

**Extensions:**  

2a. System verifies that the beginning and/or the end of the time interval is invalid (missing/not a number/negative number).

  * 2a.1. System composes a SOAP fault message.

  * 2a.2. Use case continues from step 5.

2b. System verifies that the beginning of the time interval of requested operational data is bigger than the end of the time interval.

  * 2b.1. System composes a SOAP fault message.

  * 2c.2. Use case continues from step 5.

2d. System verifies that the end of the time interval of requested operational data is bigger or equal to the value of *current time - configured offset seconds* of the monitoring daemon.

  * 2d.1. System calculates new value for the end of the time interval *current time  - configured offset seconds - 1* for making the query and use case continues from step 3. The Unix timestamp in seconds (equal with the *current time  - configured offset seconds*) to use for the beginning of time interval of the next query is included into the response in step 4 of the use case.

2e. System verifies that the set of the requested operational data parameters contains an unknown parameter.

  * 2e.1. System composes a SOAP fault message.

  * 2e.2. Use case continues from step 5.

2f. System verifies that the identifier of a client the operational data is requested about is faulty.

  * 2f.1. System composes a SOAP fault message.

  * 2f.2. Use case continues from step 5.

3a. System verifies that the request is coming from the owner of the security server (the *clientId* included in the request corresponds to the security server owner identifier defined in the global configuration). System queries requested operational data records of either one client that is specified in the search criteria of the request or all clients (if the client is not specified in the search criteria) according to the time interval given in the request.

  * 3a.1. Use case continues from step 4.

    * 3a.1a. System verifies that no records were found and composes an empty response.

    * 3a.1b. Use case continues from step 5.

3b. System verifies that the request is coming from a regular client and queries requested operational data associated with that client of either one client that is specified in the search criteria of the request or all clients (if the client is not specified in the search criteria) according to the time interval given in the request.

  * 3b.1. System composes the response including only the operational data records associated with that client from the given time interval.

    * 3b.1a. System verifies that no records were found and composes an empty response.

    * 3b.1b. Use case continues from step 5.

4a. System verifies that no records were found.

  * 4a.1. System composes an empty response.

  * 4a.2. Use case continues from step 5.

4b. System verifies that the result of the query includes more records than the defined maximum number of records in the response allows.

  * 4b.1. System composes a response including the number of records allowed plus all records that have the same timestamp as the last included record. In case some queried records are still left over, the Unix timestamp in seconds (equal with the last included record timestamp +1 second) to use for the beginning of the time interval of the next query is included in the response.

  * 4b.2. Use case continues from step 5.
