## 1 Introduction


### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe:

-   the management of X-Road members and security servers in the central server and

-   the management of security server clients in the security server.

This document does not include

-   use cases for service and access right management – these use cases are described in the document “X-Road: Use Case Model for Service Management” \[[UC-SERVICE](#Ref_UC-SERVICE)\];

-   use cases for security token, key and certificate management in the security server – these use cases are described in the document “X-Road: Use Case Model for Security Server Management” \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\].

The use cases include verifications that take place, and the main error conditions that may be encountered during the described process. The general system errors that may be encountered in most of the use cases (e.g., database connection errors or out of memory errors) are not described in this document.

The use cases assume that the X-Road software components involved in the use cases are installed and initialised (see \[[IG-CS](#Ref_IG-CS)\] and \[[IG-SS](#Ref_IG-SS)\]).

The use cases including a human actor (the *level* of the use case is *user task*) assume that the actor is logged in to the system and has the access rights required to carry out the use case.


### 1.2 Terms and Abbreviations

The definitions for general X-Road terms can be found at <[Terms of X-Road](../terms_x-road_docs.md)>.

This section defines the terms that are not defined in the aforementioned document or that have contextual meaning specific to this document in addition to the general definition.

-   **Internal TLS certificates** are used for setting up the TLS connection between the security server and the client information systems.

-   **System configuration** consists of data stored in the database and in the various configuration files held in the file system of an X-Road component.

## 2 Use Case Model


### 2.1 Summary Use Cases

The use cases in this section summarize the minimal set of actions that need to be performed to achieve the following goals:

-   set up and register an X-Road security server;

-   register a subsystem of the security server owner as a client of the security server;

-   register a subsystem of another organization as a client of the security server.

The use cases do not describe the organizational aspects of these processes.


#### 2.1.1 UC MEMBER\_01: Configure and Register a Security Server

**System**: X-Road system

**Level**: Summary

**Component:** Central server, Security server

**Actors**:

-   CS administrator – the administrator of the central server of the local X-Road instance.

-   SS administrator – the administrator of the security server owned by the X-Road member who wishes to register it's subsystem as a security server client.

**Brief Description**: SS administrator installs, initializes and configures a security server and obtains the signing certificate of the security server owner and the authentication certificate of the security server. SS administrator initiates the registration of the security server. CS administrator completes the registration of the security server.

**Preconditions**: The use case assumes that the organization that owns the security server is registered as an X-Road member (see [2.3.7](#237-uc-member_10-add-an-x-road-member)).

**Postconditions**: The security server is ready for registering clients and for exchanging X-Road messages.

**Trigger**: An X-Road member wishes to set up a security server.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1.  SS administrator installs and initializes a security server following the instructions given in the document “X-Road 6. Security Server Installation Guide” \[[IG-SS](#Ref_IG-SS)\].

2.  SS administrator adds one or more timestamping services for the security server: UC SS\_07 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\].

3.  SS administrator configures the tokens, keys and certificates:

    -   connects the security tokens used for holding signing keys to the security server and initializes the tokens;

    -   creates a signing key for the security server owner and an authentication key for the security server: UC SS\_28 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\];

    -   creates the certificate signing requests for the created signing key and authentication key: UC SS\_29 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\];

    -   forwards the certificate signing requests to an approved certification service provider and receives the corresponding certificates;

    -   imports the signing certificate and the authentication certificate: UC SS\_30 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\].

4.  SS administrator initiates the registration of the security server:

    -   sends an authentication certificate registration request from the security server: UC SS\_34 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\] (the request is served by the central server: [2.3.25](#2325-uc-member_27-serve-a-management-service-request)) and

    -   sends an authentication certificate registration request to the X-Road governing authority via out-of-band means.

5.  CS administrator completes the registration of the security server:

    -   adds the security server as an owned server to the X-Road member: [2.3.9](#239-uc-member_12-add-an-owned-security-server-to-an-x-road-member) and

    -   approves the registration requests: [2.3.35](#2335-uc-member_36-approve-an-authentication-certificate-registration-request).

    -   The central server generates and distributes global configuration that contains the created registration relations between the security server owner and the security server, and between the security server and the authentication certificate: UC GCONF\_18 \[[UC-GCONF](#Ref_UC-GCONF)\].

6.  SS administrator waits for the security server to update configuration: UC GCONF\_23 \[[UC-GCONF](#Ref_UC-GCONF)\] and verifies that the state of the security server owner and the authentication certificate is *registered*: [2.4.1](#241-uc-member_44-view-security-server-clients) and UC SS\_19 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\].

7.  SS administrator activates the authentication certificate: UC SS\_32 \[[UC-SS](#Ref_UC-SS)\].

**Main Success Scenario**:

1.  SS administrator adds a subsystem of the security server owner as a client of the security server: [2.4.4](#244-uc-member_47-add-a-client-to-the-security-server).

2.  SS administrator initiates the registration of the subsystem:

    -   sends a security server client request from the security server: [2.4.5](#245-uc-member_48-register-a-security-server-client) (the request is served by the central server: [2.3.25](#2325-uc-member_27-serve-a-management-service-request)) and

    -   sends a security server client request to the X-Road governing authority via out-of-band means.

3.  CS administrator completes the registration of the subsystem:

    -   creates a security server client registration request: [2.3.13](#2313-uc-member_15-create-a-security-server-client-registration-request) and

    -   approves the registration requests: [2.3.36](#2336-uc-member_37-approve-a-security-server-client-registration-request).

    -   The central server generates and distributes global configuration that contains the created registration relation between the security server and the subsystem: UC GCONF\_18 \[[UC-GCONF](#Ref_UC-GCONF)\].

4.  SS administrator waits for the security server to update configuration: UC GCONF\_23 \[[UC-GCONF](#Ref_UC-GCONF)\] and verifies that the state of the subsystem is *registered*: [2.4.1](#241-uc-member_44-view-security-server-clients).

5.  In case the subsystem is used in the service client role, SS administrator configures the settings for internal server communication: [2.4.6](#246-uc-member_49-change-a-security-server-clients-internal-server-connection-type), and adds internal TLS certificates to the subsystem if HTTPS connection is used: [2.4.7](#247-uc-member_50-add-a-security-server-clients-internal-tls-certificate).

6.  In case the subsystem is used in the service provider role, SS administrator:

    -   adds internal TLS certificates to the subsystem if HTTPS connection is used to communicate with the internal servers: [2.4.7](#247-uc-member_50-add-a-security-server-clients-internal-tls-certificate) and

### 2.2 Actors

The use case model for X-Road member management includes the following actors.

-   **SS administrator** (security server administrator) – a person responsible for managing the security server.

-   **CS administrator** (central server administrator) – a person responsible for managing the central server.

-   **Security server** – a security server that sends management service requests to the central server. The authentication certificate deletion requests, and security server client registration and deletion requests are forwarded to the central server by the management services' security server. The authentication certificate registration request is sent directly to the central server by the security server that the certificate is to be registered for.

-   **Management services' security server** – a security server that has the management services' provider for this X-Road instance registered as a security server client.

Relationships between the actors, systems and use cases are described in [Figure 1](#Ref_Use_case_diagram_for_member_management).
